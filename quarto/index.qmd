# Introduction

*How humanitarians estimate travel time*

*Travel time is a more prominent indicator now due to JIAF*

*Travel time is one small component of service access*

*Advances in health facility data, DTM and OSM*

*Computational approaches to service access*

*Building upon previous work with Manon*

# Objectives

- Compare [service](https://google.com) access measurement via KI and computational approaches
- Utilize computational approaches to quality check key informant data.
- Identify priority locations to investigate barriers other than travel time 
- Reproducible approach that can be systematized

# Methodology
- Overview of sites, facilities and combined
- Focus on 1 country Mozambique
- Get IDP location data, health facility data

# Analysis
## Mandruzi IDP site
Map of IDP site, health sites and route to nearest facility.
Comparing to KI


![The closest health facility to Mandruzi is Centro de Saude de Dondo](../notebooks/figures/moz-static-focus.svg){#fig-static fig-align="left" width=100%}

Mandruzi is approx. 4km (49mins walk) to Centro de Saude de Dondo *(browse and measure the route in the interactive map)*

## Spatial distribution of IDP sites and Health Facilities
<iframe width=100% height=600px src="../notebooks/figures/moz-dynamic-all.html"></iframe>
Browse all IDP sites, health facilities and routes to the nearest health facility

## Distribution of computed travel times
*histogram of computed times...*
![The median travel time to a health facility is 128 minutes](../notebooks/figures/moz-static-hist-computed.svg){#fig-static fig-align="left" width=100%}


*histogram of KI times...*

### Comparison against KI responses
..
*how many sites have different computed times to KI times?*

## Patterns of variance
..
*what are the potential explanations as to why this variance exists?*

### QC - enumerators
...
*do some enumerators have more responses that differ from the computed travel time than others? (flagging potential issues for better training or quality control)*

### Spatial patterns
*is there any spatial clustering of sites with a mismatch? This could be a flag to highlight areas where barriers other than travel time maybe be a key factor*
list of sites to further examine barriers

# Findings
Ask travel time in minutes, with inclusion of mode.
Check for patterns by KI which may indicate QC issues.

# Limitations & next steps
Road networks
Types
Elevation
Systematizing
